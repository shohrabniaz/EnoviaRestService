# We need to keep the structureName.txt file with Structure_delete_final.tcl in the same folder
# In the structureName.txt file we should keep the TNR like the following:
Type:CreateAssembly
Name:RAUZ10120012022OMF
Revision:A.1
#There should be no extra white space in structureName.txt file
# When we will run Structure_delete_final.tcl, it will generate two new file:
1.structureDelete_execution.log
2.structureDelete_data.txt
#We are keeping the logs in structureDelete_execution.log file and the unique item from the structure
in structureDelete_data.txt file
